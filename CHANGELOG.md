`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** — a change that breaks an existing scene or workflow.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-18

Housekeeping release — no functional change to the tool or the installer.

### Changed
- Documentation image links repaired: `turn-table-result.png` renamed to
  `turntable-result.png`; the not-yet-shot `config-*.png` cells now read
  _screenshot TODO_ instead of showing broken images.
- `CLAUDE.md` moved to the repository root so Claude Code loads it
  automatically; its internal paths updated for the new layout.

### Removed
- Six unreferenced screenshots pruned from `docs/images/`.
- Duplicate toolchain scripts in the working folder removed in favour of the
  canonical `tools/` copies (repo is now the single source of truth).

### Added
- `tools/new-release.ps1` — one-step versioned backup (commit + tag + ZIP).
- `_CLAUDE_/` handoff notes (`HANDOFF.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`) kept local via
  `.gitignore`.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-18

First public release.

### Added
- `setup_lookdev_scene.py` — one-shot converter that rebuilds the scene,
  installs the Lookdev Switcher, and removes itself.
- `lookdev_switcher.py` — the in-scene panel: five configuration buttons,
  depth-of-field control for all cameras at once, and one-press turntable
  rigging for imported models.
- Documentation: `README`, `docs/MANUAL.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`,
  `docs/MAINTAINING.md`.
- Maintainer toolchain in `tools/` — `dump_scene.py`, `compare_scenes.py`,
  `diff_blends.py`, `make_migration.py` — used to derive the setup script by
  diffing the untouched original scene against the reworked copy.

### Notes
- The Studio Lookdev scene by albin is **not** included and never will be —
  the repository ships names and numbers only, no geometry.
- Conversion raises sampling to 1024 and switches render output to multi-layer
  EXR. Both are reversible; see the reference.
- Built and tested on Blender 5.2 (ACES 2.0 colour management, 5.x compositor).
